``ngesh`` is a Python library and related command-line tools for simulating
phylogenetic trees and related data (characters, states, branch length, etc.).
It is intended for benchmarking phylogenetic methods, especially in Historical
Linguistics and stemmatics, and for providing dummy trees for their development
and debugging. The generation of stochastic phylogenetic trees also goes by
the name of "simulation methods for phylogenetic trees" or just
"phylogenetic tree simulation".
